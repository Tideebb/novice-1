My user name is Tidebb,computer language is hard to learn,but it is full of intereting as well.With time comes by,I can be a proficient programer and make contribute to thegrowth of github.
Meanwhile,I hope there are somebody who can give me some guidance along the way to be a programmer,It is kind of rough to study independently. 
Recently,I am reading a book named《Introducing Python》which is written in English.I am not a good english learner and many familar words are interpreted into some never seen meaning.
